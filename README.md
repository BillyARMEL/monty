Monty Interpreter
These is monty interpreter built on C language and complient with ISO90,ISO099. &ISO11.it reads monty bytcode files of any extension.However I prefer if you use .m extension.

monty can run as either a stack (LIFO) or queue(FIFO).Mode can be switched mid-script. the interpreter can handle a varity opcodes, including printing, mathmatical operations, and more all handled opcodes are listed below.
